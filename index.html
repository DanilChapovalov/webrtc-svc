    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This specification extends the WebRTC specification [[WEBRTC]] to
    enable configuration of encoding parameters for scalable video coding (SVC). 
    Since SVC bitstreams are self-describing and SVC-capable codecs implemented
    in browsers require that compliant decoders be capable of decoding any
    legal encoding sent by an encoder, this specification does not support
    decoder configuration. However, it is possible for decoders that cannot
    decode any legal bitstream to describe the supported scalability modes.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="conformance">
    <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
    product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it
    contains.</p>
    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
    implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
    particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
    easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>
    <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
    this specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the
    ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL-1]], as
    this specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
     <p>The <code><a href=
      "http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#eventhandler">EventHandler</a></code>
      interface, representing a callback used for event handlers, and the <a href=
      "http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#errorevent"><code><dfn>ErrorEvent</dfn></code></a>
      interface are defined in [[!HTML51]].</p>
      <p>The concepts <dfn><a href=
      "http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#queue-a-task">queue a task</a></dfn>,
      <dfn><a href=
      "http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#fire-a-simple-event">fires a simple
      event</a></dfn> and <dfn><a href=
      "http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#networking-task-source">networking
      task source</a></dfn> are defined in [[!HTML51]].</p>
      <p>The terms <dfn>event</dfn>, <dfn><a href=
      "http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#event-handlers">event
      handlers</a></dfn> and <dfn><a href=
      "http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#event-handler-event-type">event
      handler event types</a></dfn> are defined in [[!HTML51]].</p>
      <p>When referring to exceptions, the terms <dfn><a
      href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL-1/#dfn-throw">throw</a></dfn> and
      <dfn data-dfn-for="exception"><a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL-1/#dfn-create-exception">create</a></dfn> are
      defined in [[!WEBIDL-1]].</p>
      <p>The term <dfn>simulcast envelope</dfn> refers to the maximum number of
      simulcast streams and the order of the encoding parameters.</p>
      <p>The terms <dfn data-lt="fulfill|fulfillment">fulfilled</dfn>, <dfn
      data-lt="reject|rejection|rejecting">rejected</dfn>,
      <dfn data-lt="resolve|resolves">resolved</dfn>, <dfn>pending</dfn> and

      [[!ECMASCRIPT-6.0]].</p>
      <p>The terms <dfn>MediaStream</dfn>, <dfn>MediaStreamTrack</dfn>, and
      <dfn>MediaStreamConstraints</dfn> are defined in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].</p>
     <p>For Scalable Video Coding (SVC), the terms single-session transmission
    (<dfn>SST</dfn>) and multi-session transmission (<dfn>MST</dfn>) are
    defined in [[RFC6190]]. This specification only supports <a>SST</a> but
    not <a>MST</a>. The term Single Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) stream
    Single Transport (<dfn>SRST</dfn>), defined in [[RFC7656]] Section 3.7,
    refers to Scalable Video Coding (<dfn>SVC</dfn>) implementations that transmit
    all layers within a single transport, using a single RTP stream and
    synchronization source (SSRC). The term Multiple RTP stream Single Transport
    (<dfn>MRST</dfn>), also defined in [[RFC7656]] Section 3.7, refers to
    implementations that transmit all layers within a single transport, using
    multiple RTP streams with a distinct SSRC for each layer. This specification
    only supports <a>SRST</a> transport. Codecs with RTP payload specifications
    supporting <a>SRST</a> transport include VP8 [[RFC7741]], VP9 [[VP9-PAYLOAD]]
    and H.264/SVC [[RFC6190]].</p>
    <p>This specification references objects, methods, internal slots and dictionaries defined in
    [[!WEBRTC]], including the <dfn>RTCPeerConnection</dfn> object (defined in Section 4.4),
    the <dfn>RTCError</dfn> object (defined in Section 11.1),
    the <dfn>addTrack</dfn> and <dfn>addTransceiver</dfn> methods (defined in Section 5.1),
    the <dfn>setCodecPreferences</dfn> method (defined in Section 5.4),

    <h2>Operational model</h2>
    <p>This specification extends [[!WEBRTC]] to enable configuration of encoding
    parameters for SVC, as well as discovery of the SVC capabilities of both an
    encoder and decoder, by extending the {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters}}
    and {{RTCRtpCodecCapability}} dictionaries.</p>
    <p>Since this specification does not change the behavior of WebRTC
    objects and methods, restrictions relating to Offer/Answer negotiation and
    encoding parameters remain, as described in [[!WEBRTC]] Section 5.2: 
    "{{setParameters}} does not cause SDP renegotiation and can
    only be used to change what the media stack is sending or receiving within the
    envelope negotiated by Offer/Answer."</p>
    <p>The configuration of SVC-capable codecs implemented in browsers fits within this
    restriction. Codecs such as VP8 [[RFC6386]], VP9 [[VP9]] and AV1 [[AV1]] mandate support
    for SVC and require a compliant decoder to be able to decode any compliant encoding
    that an encoder can send. Therefore, for these codecs there is no need to
    configure the decoder or to negotiate SVC support within Offer/Answer, enabling
    encoding parameters to be used for SVC configuration.</p>
    <section id="error-handling">
      <h2>Error handling</h2>
      <p>
        [[!WEBRTC]] Section 5.2 describes error handling in
        {{setParameters}}, including use of {{RTCError}}
        to indicate a "hardware-encoder-error" due to an unsupported encoding
        parameter, as well as <code>OperationError</code> for other errors.
        Implementations of this specification utilize {{RTCError}}
        and <code>OperationError</code> in the prescribed manner when an invalid
        <code>scalabilityMode</code> value is provided to 
        {{setParameters}} or {{addTransceiver}}.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that since the {{addTransceiver}} and
        {{setCodecPreferences}} methods can be called
        before the Offer/Answer negotiation has concluded, the negotiated
        codec and its capabilities may not be known, and it is
        possible that the <code>scalabilityMode</code> values configured in
        <code>sendEncodings</code> cannot be applied due to incompatibility with
        the eventually selected codec. Since this cannot be determined at the
        time {{addTransceiver}} is called, an error may only
        be detected if a <code>scalabilityMode</code> value is invalid for any
        supported codec. In order for the application to determine whether the
        requested <code>scalabilityMode</code> values have been applied,  the
        <code><a>RTCRtpSender</a>.getParameters</code> method can be called
        after negotiation has completed and the sending codec has been determined.
        If the configuration is not satisfactory, the application can utilize
        {{setParameters}} to change it.
      </p>
      <p>
        To influence the Offer/Answer negotiation so as to make it more likely
        that the desired <code>scalabilityMode</code> values can be applied,
        {{setCodecPreferences}} can be used to limit the
        negotiated codecs to those supporting the desired configuration.
        For example, if it is desired to support temporal scalability as well as
        spatial adaptation, when {{addTransceiver}} is called,
        <code>sendEncodings</code> can be configured so as to send
        multiple simulcast streams with different resolutions, with each stream
        utilizing temporal scalability. Since temporal scalability is supported
        by the VP8, VP9 and AV1 codecs, such a configuration could be applied
        if any of these codecs were negotiated. In the event that H.264/AVC was
        negotiated, temporal scalability would not be available, but
        simulcast with different resolutions would be applied. If this was
        unsatisfactory, a subsequent call to {{setParameters}}
        could be used to adjust the parameters within the envelope negotiated
        in Offer/Answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In situations where the decoder cannot necessarily decode anything that an
        encoder can send (e.g. an H.264/SVC decoder), the <code>getCapabilities</code>
        method can be used to retrieve the scalability modes supported by the decoder
        and encoder. By exchanging capabilities, the application can compute the
        intersection of the <code>scalabilityMode</code> values supported by the
        local and remote peers, enabling it to configure <code>scalabilityMode</code>
        values supported by both the local and remote peers using the
        {{addTransceiver}} and {{setParameters}} methods.
        However, in situations where SVC modes are negotiated in SDP Offer/Answer,
        {{setParameters}} can only change <code>scalabilityMode</code>
        values within the envelope negotiated by Offer/Answer, resulting in an error
        if the requested <code>scalabilityMode</code> value is outside this envelope.

              omit the <code>scalabilityModes</code> member. However, decoders that only support
              decoding of a subset of scalability modes MUST return a sequence of the scalability
              modes supported by that codec.</p>
              <p class="note">
                  The <code>scalabilityModes</code> sequence represents the scalability modes supported
                  by a user agent. While the user agent's SVC capabilities are assumed to be static, this
                  may not be the case for a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU), whose ability to forward SVC
                  modes may depend on the negotiated header extensions.  For example, if the SFU cannot parse
                  codec payloads (either because it is not designed to do so, or because the payloads are
                  confidential), then negotiation of an RTP header extension (such as the AV1 Descriptor
                  defined in Appendix A of [[AV1-RTP]] or frame marking [[FRAME-MARKING]]) may be required
                  to enable the SFU to forward scalability modes.  As a result, an application may choose
                  to exchange <code>scalabilityModes</code> with an SFU after the initial offer/answer
                  negotiation, so that the SFU's supported <code>scalabilityModes</code> can be determined,
                  allowing the application to compute the intersection of supported <code>scalabilityModes</code>.

    <h2>Privacy and Security Considerations</h2>
    <p>This section is non-normative; it specifies no new behaviour, but
    instead summarizes information already present in other parts of the
    specification. The overall security considerations of the
    APIs and protocols used in WebRTC are described in
    [[RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]].</p>
    <section>
      <h2>Impact on same origin policy</h2>
      <p>This API enables data to be communicated between
      browsers and other devices, including other browsers.</p>
      <p>This means that data can be shared between applications
      running in different browsers, or between an application running in the
      same browser and something that is not a browser.  This is an extension
      to the Web model which has had barriers against sending data
      between entities with different origins.</p>
      <p>This specification provides no user prompts or chrome indicators
      for communication; it assumes that once the Web page has been allowed to
      access data, it is free to share that data with other entities as it
      chooses.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Impact on local network</h2>
      <p>Since the browser is an active platform executing in a trusted network
      environment (inside the firewall), it is important to limit the damage
      that the browser can do to other elements on the local network, and it is
      important to protect data from interception, manipulation and
      modification by untrusted participants.</p>
      <p>Mitigations include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An UA will always request permission from the correspondent UA to
        communicate using ICE. This ensures that the UA can only send to
        partners who you have shared credentials with.</li>
        <li>An UA will always request ongoing permission to continue sending
        using ICE consent [[!RFC7675]]. This enables a receiver to withdraw
        consent to receive.</li>
        <li>An UA will always encrypt data, with strong per-session keying.</li>
        <li>An UA will always use congestion control. This ensures that QUIC
        cannot be used to flood the network.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These measures are specified in the relevant IETF documents.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Confidentiality of Communications</h2>
      <p>The fact that communication is taking place cannot be hidden from
      adversaries that can observe the network, so this has to be regarded as
      public information.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Persistent information</h2>
      <p>The WebRTC API exposes information about the
      underlying media system via the <code><a>RTCRtpSender</a>.getCapabilities</code>
      and <code><a>RTCRtpReceiver</a>getCapabilities</code> methods, including
      detailed and ordered information about the codecs that the system is able
      to produce and consume. The WebRTC-SVC extension adds supported SVC modes
      to that information, which is in most cases persistent across time and origins,
      therefore increasing the fingerprint surface.</p>
